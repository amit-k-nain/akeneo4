Installation instructions
-------------------------

### Development Installation with Docker

## Requirements
 - Docker 19+
 - docker-compose >= 1.24
 - make

## Creating a project and starting the PIM
The following steps will install Akeneo PIM in the current directory (must be empty) and launch it from there:

```bash
$ docker run -u www-data -v $(pwd):/srv/pim -w /srv/pim --rm akeneo/pim-php-dev:4.0 \
    php -d memory_limit=4G /usr/local/bin/composer create-project --prefer-dist \
    akeneo/pim-community-standard /srv/pim "4.0.*@stable"
```
```
$ make

```

The PIM will be available on http://localhost:8080/, with `admin/admin` as default credentials.

To shutdown your PIM: `make down`

### Installation without Docker


```bash
$ php -d memory_limit=4G /usr/local/bin/composer create-project --prefer-dist \
    akeneo/pim-community-standard /srv/pim "4.0.*@stable"
```

You will need to change the `.env` file to configure the access to your MySQL and ES server.

Once done, you can run:

```
$ NO_DOCKER=true make
